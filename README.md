# Code Challenge: Class 12

# First-in, First-out Animal Shelter

# Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
The shelter should have an enqueue(animal) method that will add either a cat or dog object to the shelter.
The shelter should also have a dequeue(pref) method that takes a preference of either cat or dog and returns either a cat or dog based on that preference.

# Approach and Efficiency
enqueue Big O: O(n)
dequeue Big O:O(1)

# Solution
